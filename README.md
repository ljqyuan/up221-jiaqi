## Project ideas

* visualizing housing inequalities among population especially migrant/vulnerable groups
* visualizing evolution of urban landscape / gentrification and shifting of demographics
* visualizing denstiy of services/mix-use of land and vulnerable population (youth, aging population, migrants, etc.)
* open to more ideas about vulnerable population, urban sustainability, pedestrian-oriented design...

## Course objectives

* Learn solid coding techniques to pruduce maps, charts, and other visual/interactive stuff
* Learn how to build related convincing models

Excited to learn and work with y'all! :heart:
