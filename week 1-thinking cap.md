### Summary

This news article is the transcript of the interview with scientists Liv Yoon, Joey Williams and their team
regarding New York City heat levels and social inequalities. The project was part of a nationwide campaign
to investigate the disproportional impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities.Urban data scientists 
collect data by sensors and combine them with other land varaibles to predict the heat across the full study 
area, projecting a map that demonstrates various heat levels across the land and its relation with the 
distribution of different neighborhoodsor communities. Their findings show that urban climate is racialized 
and is inter-related with socio-economic status of residents, and they did a great job in connecting the dots 
among topics in urban cliate change to emphasize its threat multiplier effect.

The team applied both on-field data collection and satellite data collection, which increases the accuracy of 
heat data acquisition. In addition, the project engaged local community members and stakeholders and thus allowed a
participatory process. Finally, the team conducted a multi-perspective analysis of the heat map they produced with
other maps of health, demographics, air quality, urban green space and more. I find the research not only informative
but also extremely interactive and multi-layered. Our project for UP221 should also be from multiple perspectives,
solid in data collecting methods and well connected to urban justice.

### Graphical Component

THe graphical components for the project are compelling. The team collected their own data by individual sensors
in the field and combined with land varaibles acquired through high-resolution satellite imagery. They built 
models on base maps including: Esri, HERE, Garmin, Intermap, increment P Corp., GEBCO, USGS, FAO, NPS, NRCAN, 
GeoBase, IGN, Kadaster NL, Ordnance Survey, Esri Japan, METI, Esri China (Hong Kong), OpenStreetMap contributors, 
and the GIS User Community. Since there are many data sources and map types, the team was able to create cross-referenced
maps containing different messages of heat, health, air quality, and so on successfully. In the interactive map of 
NYC heat story, the platform provides several subsections that allow audience to explore and to compare the heat
level with other existing properties such as transit connections, green space, walking condition.
